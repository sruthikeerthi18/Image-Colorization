# Image Colorization
The task is to use a convolutional neural network for image colorization which turns a grayscale image to a colored image. By converting an image to grayscale, we loose color information, so converting a grayscale image back to a colored version is not an easy job.

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. The model was trained on the colour images and tested using the greyscale images.
